'Providence Crab' was bred and developed by Dr. John A. Cline, a professor of tree fruit physiology and pomology in the Ontario Agricultural Collage at the University of Guelph. 

The apple was tested and grown at his research orchards  at the Horticultural Experiment Station, Simcoe, ON, Canada, now named the Ontario Crops Research Centre – Simcoe. It originated from an open-pollinated cross conducted in 2000 between the variety 'Empire' as the female parent. The male parent is unknown (because it was open pollinated). The resulting seeds were germinated in 2001 and the seedlings were transplanted to an orchard in 2002. 

One seedling numbered ‘B17Crab7’ was selected for its unique fruit qualities and propagated onto clonal M.26 rootstock for further evaluation. Trees were then planted in 2007 in replicated and randomized fashion of two trees per plot with other crab apple selections as well as the reference cultivars for further evaluation. Several trees have been grafted on dwarfing rootstock and are now in production at the Simcoe Research Station as of 2015.
