| Tree vigor               | High vigor when grafted on M.26 EMLA rootstock; trees grafted on M.9 rootstock would be smaller but would display in a category of high vigor in comparison with other fresh-market apples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Fruit colour             | The fruit are the most distinguishing feature of ‘Providence Crab’. The fruit are very distinct with reddish-purple skin colour and red flesh through the mesocarp, and crimson juice when extracted. The tree has red leaves at bloom that turn dark green during development. Flowers are pink in color when fully open. The shoots have a distinctly red colour which is clearly distinguishable from other crab apples. |

| Uniformity and stability | Providence Crab has been grown for over 10 years and provided very consistent results. The tree is consistent is size and growth habit, and the cultivar is consistent similar size, shape, flavour and colour characteristics of fruits annually. No variants or off- types were observed during the development of the variety.                                                                                           |
